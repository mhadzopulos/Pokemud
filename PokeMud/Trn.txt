Cut it out! You know I'm too old to do the hankie pankie.
Alright let me see your balls for a second.
If you need to heal just ask me. You should be heading up to Diamond City, though.

I'd be glad to help you out!
You should see Jacey for healing or head up to Diamond City. Just follow route 1 and you will find your way.

Save the battles for the gym.
This is the great dragon gym of Opal City. Be warned you must have all other badges and some good pokemon!

Are you ready kid? This is your last test!
I am Vladimir. Of course by now you know that I train only the greatest of pokemon and dragons are by far the best.
I can't believe it kid, you beat me! Here is the official badge of the Opal Gym!
I have already been shamed recently. Go battle someone else.
